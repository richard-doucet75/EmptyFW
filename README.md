Certainly! Given the clarification that "EmptyFM" stands for "MT Framework" which in turn stands for "Multi-Tenant Framework," here's a revised version of your `README.md` to reflect this information more accurately.

### Revised README.md Content

```markdown
# EmptyFM

## Description

- **Customizable**: Designed to be highly adaptable, allowing developers to tailor the framework to their specific needs.
- **.NET Based**: Built using the latest .NET technologies to ensure high performance and broad compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (appropriate version as per project setup, e.g., .NET 6.0 or later)
- Git installed on your machine
- JetBrains Rider or another preferred .NET-compatible IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmptyFM.git

### Steps to Update README.md in Your Project

1. **Update the README.md File**:
   - Open your existing `README.md` file in the root directory of your `EmptyFM` project.
   - Replace the content with the updated markdown provided above.

2. **Save and Close the File**.

3. **Push the Updated README to GitHub**:
   - Use the terminal or command prompt to execute these Git commands:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Updated README.md to reflect project's full name and purpose"
     git push origin main
     ```

This update ensures that the README clearly communicates the project's purpose as a multi-tenant framework, aligning with the naming clarification and enhancing the project's presentation on GitHub.
